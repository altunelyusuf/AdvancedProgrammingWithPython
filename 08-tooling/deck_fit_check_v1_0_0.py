"""Refuses a deck whose text does not fit the box it was put in, whose text boxes print on top of one another, or
whose content slide carries no speaker notes. The deck is re-opened from the finished file and every text frame re-measured, independently of the
renderer that wrote it: for each frame the text is wrapped greedily at the frame's own width using the average advance
width of its font at its own size, the resulting line count is turned back into a height, and the frame is refused
when that height is more than the frame's height plus a tolerance. Monospaced text is measured at its exact advance
width, so a code box that overflows cannot pass.

Measurement is an estimate, deliberately a pessimistic one: the average advance used for the proportional faces is
wider than the real average of English prose, so the check errs towards refusing a frame that would in fact fit.
